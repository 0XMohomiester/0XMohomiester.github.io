Hello,  In this Writeup, we will Explain methods for executing non-alphabetical PHP code to bypass PHP filters in [PHP - EVAL](https://www.root-me.org/fr/Challenges/Web-Serveur/PHP-Eval) challenge.

Firstly, we will analyze the source code of the challenge.
```
<head>
</head>
<body>
 
<h4> PHP Calc </h4>
 
<form action='index.php' method='post'>
    <input type='text' id='input' name='input' />
    <input type='submit' />
<?php
 
if (isset($_POST['input'])) {
    if(!preg_match('/[a-zA-Z`]/', $_POST['input'])){
        print '<fieldset><legend>Result</legend>';
        eval('print '.$_POST['input'].";");
        print '</fieldset>';
    }
    else
        echo "<p>Dangerous code detected</p>";
}
?>
</form>
</body>
</html>

```
The PHP script first checks if a POST parameter named  `input`  is present. If the input lacks letters or backticks, it's evaluated as PHP code using eval(), with the result printed on the screen. However, if letters or backticks are detected, it warns of "Dangerous code."

After some Reasearch on google, I found a way to bypass this filter which is `bypass using Non alphabetical char encoding.` Let's Discuss and we can use [onlinegdb](https://www.onlinegdb.com/) to test and run php code easily and faster. In php we can use XOR operator between characters not only numbers to produce another character.

So, here's the idea of our attack, what if we can reproduce an alphabetical char from `xoring two non alphabetical chars.` How can we do that ? 
The XOR operator works like this: When you XOR any two numbers, it produces a result. If you then XOR this result with one of the original numbers, you'll get the other original number. 
We can take a Demo form the following python test on python Interpreter. We can choose character like `s` that we want to produce it using XOR operator of two unkown character.

Steps of what we can do: 

1) Getting ASCII decimal of the letter `s` which is 115 using ord() function in python.

2) Selecting a random non-alphabetical-char like `@` and getting an ASCII decimal of this char which is 64.

3) XORING this two decimal numbers and convert the result into char using chr() in python.

4) Checking if the char is alphabetical char or not and the goal is to be non-alphabetical-char to bypass the filter.

5) Finally, xoring the random non-alphabetical-char and the number resulted from xor operation will give us the letter we need to need.
