## Introduction
[PHP - Unserialize Pop Chain](https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/Web-Server/PHP-Unserialize-Pop-Chain)  is a very nice web challenge designed to understand the concept of **magic method chaining** in the deserialization process.

As we know that [serialization](https://hazelcast.com/foundations/distributed-computing/serialization/) is the process of converting a data object or a combination of code into a series of bytes, preserving the object's state in an easily transmittable form. Deserialization is the reverse operation of serialization.

## What is the Magic Methods?
[Magic methods](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php) are special methods which override PHP's default's action when certain actions are performed on an object. All methods names starting with __ are reserved by PHP.

## What is POP chain? 

POP stands for `Property Oriented Programming` which means that the attacker can control all of the properties of the deserialized object. POP chains work by chaining code "gadgets" together to achieve the attackerâ€™s ultimate goal. These "gadgets" are code snippets borrowed from the codebase that the attacker uses to further her goal.

In normal scenario of exploiting insecure deserialization vulnerability, an attacker controls a serialized object that is passed into `unserialize()`. This will then allow her the opportunity to hijack the execution flow of the application, by controlling the values passed into magic methods.

The problem is: What if the declared magic methods does not contain any usefull code to perform my attack?
Now the exploitation of unsafe deserialization is useless, right?
